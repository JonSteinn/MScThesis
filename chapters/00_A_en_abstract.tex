\textbf{Introduction.} This thesis introduces a fully automated and domain agnostic bijection search built on top of an existing automated specification framework. \textbf{Methods.} We define a binary relation on specifications, which is used to define a bijection between their classes. This theory is accompanied by a search method for specifications satisfying this relation. \textbf{Results.} The search method was mainly applied to the domain of permutation patterns, where a total of 1324 bijections have been found, excluding symmetries and compositions. \textbf{Conclusion.} As far as we know, this is the first ever fully automated bijection with prior attempts requiring mathematical preliminary work.
