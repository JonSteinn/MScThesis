\coverchapter{Acknowledgements}
First, I would like to thank my wife Sólborg for all her support and for proofreading this thesis multiple times, which must look like total gibberish to her.

I would also like to thank my advisors Henning and Christian. Henning for all his guidance through out my studies, his suggestion of this topic and help with the thesis. Christian for assisting with implementations and getting acquainted with the Combinatorial Exploration framework. Furthermore, I would like to thank Émile and Jay for all their help.

Last but not least, I want to thank my mother-in-law and my late father-in-law for all their help with the kids during my studies.
