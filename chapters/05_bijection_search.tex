\section{The bijection search algorithm}
\todo[inline, caption={}]{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain in words what the algorithm does and how it is build on top of css
    \item Explain the two searches [gather matching info, construct spec]
    \item Provide algorithms for the two searches
    \item Analyze (big-0), although this is probably dominated by CSS' complexity
    \item Reference minimal working example appendix
    \item Give an example
    \item Move to background?
\end{itemize}
}

\section{Nonbijective rules}
\todo[inline,caption={}]{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain how we handle this with indexed maps
    \item This will probably just be a discussion without theory
    \item Give a detailed example of $\Av{132} \mapsto \Av{123}$.
\end{itemize}
