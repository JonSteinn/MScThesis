\section{Title on breaking down root classes (+other way)}
\todo[inline,caption={}]{
\begin{itemize}
    \item forward map
    \item backward map
    \item define spec that includes f\&b maps for all rules, bijectable? 
    \item Deal with `None` (mutual exclusivity) in rules and always map to tuples. Probably need to define `mutually exclusive constructors` or something like that. If paths are used, it doesn't rly matter as long as classes are passed along but will need some notation to include the correct class.
    \item def breaking objects down into atoms (name idea: atomic segregation, desegregate other way)
    \item def building objects from 'atomized'
\end{itemize}
}

\section{Parallel bijections}
\todo[inline,caption={}]{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define map
    \item is bijective proof
    \item corollary: Parallel => Isomorphism
    \item example
\end{itemize}
}

\section{The bijection algorithm}
Implementation of the mapping itself (and maybe a few words on the inverse)
