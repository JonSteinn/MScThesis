\section{Combinatorics\label{sec:combinatorics}}
A \emph{combinatorial class} is a set $\mathcal{C}$ and a size function $\mathcal{C} \mapsto \N = \set{0,1,2,\dotsc}$ such that for all $n\in\N$, the set
\[
    \mathcal{C}_n = \cset{c \in \mathcal{C}}{\text{size of $c$ is $n$}}
\]
is finite. We refer to an element of a combinatorial class, $c\in\mathcal{C}$, as a \emph{combinatorial object} and its size (or length) is denoted by $|c|$. The set of words over a finite alphabet is an example of a combinatorial class where the number of characters in the word serves as a size function.

A \emph{bijection} between sets $A$ and $B$ is an invertible function $f: A \mapsto B$ such that $a=f^{-1}(f(a))$ and $b=f(f^{-1}(b))$ for all $a\in A$ and $b \in B$. The existance of a bijection between sets $A$ and $B$ implies $|A|=|B|$. Suppose $A$ is the set of binary strings of length $n$ avoiding consecutive 1's and $B$ the set of subsets of $\setn$ containing no consecutive numbers. By mapping each binary string $\wordseq{b}{n} \in A$ to the set containing $i$ if and only if $b_i=1$, we have a bijection. This bijection can be seen in \FigureRef{fig:bijection_example} for $n=3$.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{graphics/bijection_example}
    \caption{A bijection between binary strings of length 3 avoiding consecutive 1's and subsets of $\set{1,2,3}$ containing no consecutive numbers.}
    \label{fig:bijection_example}
\end{figure}

Given a bijection $\phi$ between two combinatorial classes $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$, we say that $\phi$ is \emph{length preserving} if $|c| = |\phi(c)|$ for all $c\in\mathcal{C}$. Suppose $\mathcal{C}$ is the set of binary strings that avoid consecutive 0's and $\mathcal{D}$ the set of binary strings that avoid consecutive 1's. The bijection that flips the bits in a binary string is a length preserving bijection between $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$. The bijection between the binary strings and subsets we mentioned earlier is not length preserving if cardinality is used as a size function for the subsets.

For a combinatorial class $\mathcal{C}$, the infinite sequence 
\[
    |\mathcal{C}_0|, |\mathcal{C}_1|, |\mathcal{C}_2|,\dotsc,|\mathcal{C}_n|,\dotsc
\]
where each term counts the number of elements of a fixed length is called the \emph{counting seqeuence} of $\mathcal{C}$. It is the focal point of enumerative combinatorics. We might look for a formula for the terms, a recurrence relation, or an asymptotic equivalence. Another way to present the counting sequence is with a power series
\[
    \sum_{i=0}^\infty |\mathcal{C}_i|z^i
\]
called a \emph{generating function} and famously described as a ``clothesline on which we hang up a sequence of numbers for display'' in \authcite{wilf:gf}. For example the sequence of Fibonacci numbers $\left(f_i\right)_{i=0}^\infty$ has the generating function
\[
    \sum_{i=0}^\infty f_iz^i =  z + z^2 + 2z^3 + 3z^4 + 5z^5 + 8z^6 + \dotsb = \frac{z}{1-z-z^2}.
\]

If two combinatorial classes $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ share a counting sequence we say they are \emph{isomorphic}, denoted $\mathcal{C} \cong \mathcal{D}$. This is equivalent to the existence of a length preserving bijection between $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$. Isomorphism is an equivalence relation on the set of all combinatorial classes.

The \emph{symbolic method} in \authcite{flajolet:ac} describes how combinatorial classes can be constructed. To that end, they define \emph{constructors}, \emph{combinatorial rules} and \emph{combinatorial specifications}. We will demonstrate these concepts with an example. 

Consider a $2 \times n$ grid where each square can be raised or not as shown in \FigureRef{fig:raised_grid}. How many unique grids exist such that one can pass from left to right?

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{graphics/raised_grid}
    \caption{A grid of length $5$ with three raised squares and a path from left to right.}
    \label{fig:raised_grid}
\end{figure}

Let $G$ be the combinatorial class for passable grids. It is either the empty grid or contains at least one vertical slice. This is described by the admissible constructor disjoint union where a combinatorial class is split into nonintersecting parts. Now we have a combinatorial rule 
\[
    G \cong \set{\varepsilon} \sqcup G_{\geq 1},
\]
where $\varepsilon$ is the empty grid and $G_{\geq 1}$ is the set of passable grid with a positive length. In terms of generating functions this corresponds to addition, that is 
\[
    G(z) = 1 + G_{\geq1}(z).
\] 
Any valid grid consists of a combination of the vertical slices \gridN, \gridU\ and \gridD\ as one with both raised would block the path. We refer to a combinatorial object of length 1 as an \emph{atom}. The generating functions of the empty object and an atom are $1$ and $z$ respectively. Let $A$, $B$ and $C$ be the classes of passable grids starting with \gridN, \gridU\ and \gridD\ respectively and $D$ and $E$ the classes that can follow \gridU\ and \gridD\ respectively. Again we have a disjoint union 
\[
    G_{\geq1} \cong A \sqcup B \sqcup C.
\]
We define $\circ$ as the operator that prepends a vertical slice to all grids in a set. This is a Cartesian product, another admissible constructor denoted by $\times$, where
\[
X \times Y = \cset{(x,y)}{x\in X \text{ and } y \in Y}
\]
and in terms of generating functions corresponds to multiplication. Now we have 
\[
    A \cong \gridN \circ G, \ B \cong \gridU \circ D \text{ and } C \cong \gridD \circ E.
\]
Following \gridU\ can be anything that does not start by blocking the lower square, that is 
\[
    D \cong \set{\varepsilon} \sqcup B \sqcup A
\]
and symmetrically we have 
\[
    E \cong \set{\varepsilon} \sqcup C \sqcup A.
\]
Now we have our specification, a system of rules with each class on the left at most once, defining an unambiguous formal grammar as shown in \FigureRef{fig:gridtree}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{graphics/tree_example}
    \caption{The grammar for passable $2\times n$ grids.}
    \label{fig:gridtree}
\end{figure}

This system of rules when interpreted with generating functions is a set of equations with functions as its unknowns. In our example we have
\[
    \systeme*{G(z) = 1 + G_{\geq1}(z), G_{\geq1}(z) = A(z) + B(z) + C(z),A(z) = zG(z), B(z) = zD(z), C(z) = zE(z), D(z) = 1+B(z)+A(z), E(z) = 1+C(z)+A(z)}
\]
and solving for $G(z)$ gives 
\[
    G(z) = \frac{1+z}{1-2z-z^2}.
\]
The Taylor series for this function, at $z=0$, is
\[
    \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{G^{(i)}(0)}{i!}z^i = 1+3z+7z^2+17z^3+ 41z^4 + 99z^5 + \dotsm
\]
which corresponds to the number of grids for each size, e.g., there are 17 and 99 unique passable $2\times3$ and $2\times5$ grids respectively. We can even go further using calculus and find the exact formula, 
\[
|G_n| = \frac{\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^{n+1} + \left(1-\sqrt{2}\right)^{n+1}}{2}.
\]
This is not always the case and depends on the type of generating function we have.

In the context of this thesis, we will usually refer to combinatorial classes as just classes and the same goes for combinatorial specifications and rules. We also assume all constructors to be admissible and all rules to entail an isomorphism. 

\section{Permutations\label{sec:permutations}}
A \emph{permutation} $\pi$ is a bijection between a set and itself. In our context, the set in question is $[n] = \setn$. We adopt a one line notation for permutations, $\pi = \perm{\pi}{n}$ where $\pi_i = j$ if $i$ maps to $j$. The permutation $1423$ maps $\{1,2,3,4\}$ to itself. This correspondence can be seen in \FigureRef{fig:perm_example} as well as a geometric representation of the permutation which displays the points $\cset{(i,\pi(i))}{i \in [n]}$ in the Cartesian plane.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{graphics/perm_example}
    \caption{The mapping and graphical representation of the permutation $1423$.}
    \label{fig:perm_example}
\end{figure}

A permutation on $[n]$ is said to be of length $n$ and $\mathcal{S}_n$ is the set of all permutations of length $n$. The set of permutations of length 3 is 
\[
    \mathcal{S}_3 = \{123,132,213,231,312,321\}.
\]
There is a permutation of length $0$, namely the empty permutation, denoted $\varepsilon$. This is the unique map from $\emptyset$ to $\emptyset$. The set of all permutations is denoted by $\mathcal{S}$. It is a combinatorial class since $\mathcal{S}_n$ is finite for all $n\in\N$, containing $n!$ elements.

Given a permutation $\pi = \perm{\pi}{n}$, its \emph{reverse} is
\[
    \rev(\pi) = \pi^\textsf{rev} = \wordrev{\pi}{n}
\]
and its \emph{inverse} is
\[
    \inv(\pi) = \pi^{-1} = \wordidx{\pi}{i}{n}
\]
where $\pi_{i_j} = k$ if $\pi_k = j$. The reverse of $132$ is $231$ and the inverse of $51324$ is $24351$. The reverse and inverse functions generate the dihedral group $D_4$, that is the symmetries of a square using the graphical representation of a permutation. We define these eight symmetry maps as $\sym_1,\sym_2,\dotsc,\sym_8$ as is shown in \TableRef{tab:permsym} which also includes an example for the permutation $1423$.

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{tables/permsym}
    \caption{The eight symmetry maps for permutations interpreted with reverse and inverse, dihedral group $D_4$ and an example for $\pi=1423$.}
    \label{tab:permsym}
\end{table}

We define $\sym(\pi) = \cset{\sym_i(\pi)}{i \in [8]}$ as the \emph{symmetries of} $\pi$. Note that two different symmetry functions can map to the same permutation, e.g., $\sym(1) = \set{1}$. Every permutation has between one and eight symmetries.

Given a finite strictly totally ordered set $(M, <)$ where $M = \set{x_1,x_2,\dotsc,x_n}$, we define its \emph{sorting} as
\[
    \sort(M) = (x_{i_1},x_{i_2},\dotsc,x_{i_n})
\]
if $x_{i_1} < x_{i_2} < \dotsm < x_{i_n}$. Suppose $M=\set{1,5,2}$, then $\sort(M) = (1,2,5)$. The \emph{indexed subsequence} of a permutation $\pi \in \mathcal{S}_n$ for indices $S\subseteq [n]$ is the sequence
\[
    \sseq{S}{\pi}=\wordidx{\pi}{i}{|S|}
\]
if $\sort(S) = (i_1,i_2,\dotsc,i_{|S|})$. Given an indexed subsequence $\gamma$ of a permutation $\pi \in \mathcal{S}_n$, its \emph{standardization}, $\st{\gamma}$, is the sequence where the $i^\text{th}$ largest entry has been replaced by $i$. Let $\pi = 41253 \in \mathcal{S}_5$ and $S=\{1,3,4\}$, then $\st{\sseq{S}{\pi}} = \st{425} = 213$.

Given two permutations $\pi \in \mathcal{S}_n$ and $\sigma \in \mathcal{S}_k$ we say that $\pi$ \emph{contains} $\sigma$, denoted $\contains{\pi}{\sigma}$, if there exists a subset $S \subseteq [n]$ such that $\st{\sseq{S}{\pi}} = \sigma$. If $\pi$ does not contain $\sigma$, it \emph{avoids} it. In the context of containment, we usually refer to the contained permutation as a (\emph{classical}\footnote{There are other types of patterns that we do not concern ourselves with in this thesis.}) \emph{pattern} and that permutations contain or avoid a pattern. The permutation $356214$ contains the pattern $4213$ since
\[
    \st{\sseq{\{2, 4, 5, 6\}}{356214}} = \st{5214} = 4213.
\]
It, however, avoids the pattern $1432$ since
\[
    1432 \notin \cset{\st{\sseq{S}{356214}}}{S \subseteq [6]}.
\]
An occurrence of $4213$ in $356214$ can be seen in \FigureRef{fig:pattern_containment}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{graphics/pattern_containment}
    \caption{The permutation $356214$ with an occurrence of $4213$ circled.}
    \label{fig:pattern_containment}
\end{figure}

A set of permutations $\Pi$ is \emph{closed downwards} with respect to containment if 
\[
    \bigcup_{\pi \in \Pi}\cset{\sigma}{\contains{\pi}{\sigma}} \subseteq \Pi.
\]
A set of permutations that is closed downwards is called a \emph{permutation class}. The set $\{\varepsilon, 1, 12, 123\}$ is closed downwards since all patterns contained in any of its elements belong to the set. We can extend this set to include all increasing permutations, $\set{\varepsilon, 1, 12, 123, 1234, \dotsc}$ and it is still closed downwards. Both sets are therefore permutation classes. Isorphism between permutation classes is often called \emph{Wilf equivalence} and their equivalence classes are called \emph{Wilf classes}. 

A permutation $\pi$ \emph{avoids} a set of permutations $\Pi$ if it avoids every $\sigma \in \Pi$. It \emph{contains} $\Pi$ if it does not avoid it, that is, it contains at least one permutation of $\Pi$. Let 
\[
    \Av{\Pi} = \cset{\pi \in \mathcal{S}}{\pi \text{ avoids } \Pi}.
\]
We may abuse this notation by omitting set brackets, writing $\Av{\sigma_1,\sigma_2}$ instead of $\Av{\set{\sigma_1,\sigma_2}}$. Define \[
    \Avn{n}{\Pi} = \cset{\pi \in \Av{\Pi}}{|\pi| = n}
\]
for $n\in\N$.

A set of permutations $\mathcal{B}$ is called a \emph{basis} if for all $\pi\in\mathcal{B}$ there does not exist a $\sigma \in \mathcal{B} \setminus \set{\pi}$ such that $\contains{\pi}{\sigma}$. The set $\{12,21\}$ is a basis while $\{12,231\}$ is not since $\contains{231}{12}$. Permutation classes can be described in terms of a basis avoided, e.g., 
\[
    \{\varepsilon,1,12,123\} = \Av{21, 1234}
\]
and
\[
    \{\varepsilon, 1, 12, 123, 1234,\dotsc\} = \Av{21}.
\]

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis. We extend the definition of symmetry maps to bases such that
\[
    \sym_i(\mathcal{B}) = \cset{\sym_i(\sigma)}{\sigma \in \mathcal{B}}
\]
and
\[
    \sym(\mathcal{B}) = \cset{\sym_i(\mathcal{B})}{i \in [8]}.
\]
For any basis $\mathcal{B}$, the \emph{symmetry class} of $\Av{\mathcal{B}}$ is $\cset{\Av{B}}{B \in \sym(\mathcal{B})}$. The symmetry class of any permutation class is a subset of its Wilf class. As symmetries are considered trivial bijections we usually only concern ourselves with the lexicographically minimal representation of each symmetry class. For example, there are seven symmetry classes and three Wilf classes for singleton bases in $\mathcal{S}_4$. They are shown in \TableRef{tab:wilfcls4}.

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        Wilf class & Counting sequence\\
        \hline
        $\begin{matrix}\Av{1234}\\\Av{1243}\\\Av{1432}\\\Av{2143}\end{matrix}$ & $1, 2, 6, 23, 103, 513, 2761, 15767, \dotsc$ \\
        \hline
        $\begin{matrix}\Av{1324}\end{matrix}$ & $1, 2, 6, 23, 103, 513, 2762, 15793,\dotsc$\\
        \hline
        $\begin{matrix}\Av{1342}\\\Av{2413}\end{matrix}$ & $1, 2, 6, 23, 103, 512, 2740, 15485,\dotsc$
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The seven lexicographically minimal representations of symmetry classes of permutation classes avoiding a single classical pattern of length $4$. They are grouped into three Wilf classes.}
    \label{tab:wilfcls4}
\end{table}

Starting from the empty permutation we can generate any permutation by inserting a new maximum element. This procedure is called the \emph{evolution} of a permutation. One way of achieving this is with \emph{insertion encoding}. We can restrict where our new maximum element can be inserted with \emph{slots} marked by $\slot$. We can transition from a sequence containing slots to another with one of the transitions shown in \TableRef{tab:ietrans}.\todo{use better diamonds}

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        Token & Transition\\
        \hline
        $\mathbf{m}$ & $\slot \ietrans \slot m \slot$\\
        $\mathbf{r}$ & $\slot \ietrans \slot m$\\
        $\mathbf{l}$ & $\slot \ietrans m \slot$\\
        $\mathbf{f}$ & $\slot \ietrans m$
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The insertion encoding transitions for a new maximum element $m$.}
    \label{tab:ietrans}
\end{table}

The insertion encoding of the permutation $615234$ is $\mathbf{m}_1\mathbf{m}_2\mathbf{l}_3\mathbf{f}_3\mathbf{f}_2\mathbf{f}_1$ since its evolution is
\begin{align*}
    \slot &\iestep{m}{1} \slot 1 \slot\\
    &\iestep{m}{2} \slot 1 \slot 2 \slot\\
    &\iestep{l}{3} \slot 1 \slot 2 3 \slot\\
    &\iestep{f}{3} \slot 1 \slot 234\\
    &\iestep{f}{2} \slot 15234\\
    &\iestep{f}{1} 615234.
\end{align*}
A more detailed definition can be found in \authcite{albert2005insertion}. Given a permutation class $\Av{\mathcal{B}}$, the set of insertion encodings of all its permutation make up the language of the class. If said language is regular\footnote{Recognized by a finite automaton.} we say that the class is \emph{regular insertion encodable}. TileScope was shown to be able to find specifications for all regular insertion encodable classes by \citeauthor{BeanPhd:phd} \cite[Theorem  5.1.3]{BeanPhd:phd}.


\section{Gridded permutations\label{sec:griddedpermutations}}
A \emph{cell} $(a,b) \in \N^2$ is the region within $[0,\infty)^2$ defined by $[a, a+1) \times [b, b+1).$ A pair
\[
    (\pi,P) = (\perm{\pi}{n}, ((a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2),\dotsc,(a_n,b_n)))
\]
where $P$ is an $n$-tuple of cells and $\pi$ is a permutation is called a \emph{gridded permutation} of length $n$ if for all $i,j \in [n]$, $i<j$ implies $a_i \leq a_j$ and $\pi_i < \pi_j$ implies $b_i \leq b_j$. A more detailed definition is given by \citeauthor{albert2012geometric} \cite{albert2012geometric}. We refer to $P$ as the \emph{positions} of the gridded permutation and $\pi$ as the \emph{underlying permutation}. We use a one line notation for gridded permutations 
\[
    \pi = \pi_1^{(a_1,b_1)}\pi_2^{(a_2,b_2)}\dotsb\pi_n^{(a_n,b_n)}
\]
where we can exclude all but the last position of consecutive occurrences of the same position. The gridded permutation $87^{(0,2)}1^{(1,0)}6^{(1,2)}2^{(1,0)}4^{(3,1)}3^{(3,0)}5^{(4,2)}$ can be seen in \FigureRef{fig:gridded_perm}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{graphics/gridded_perm}
    \caption{The gridded permutation $87^{(0,2)}1^{(1,0)}6^{(1,2)}2^{(1,0)}4^{(3,1)}3^{(3,0)}5^{(4,2)}$.}
    \label{fig:gridded_perm}
\end{figure}

We extend the definition of indexed subsequences to gridded permutations so the sequence produced, $\sseq{S}{\pi}$, contains elements of the underlying permutation and positions. Given this extension, we can also extend the standardization of an indexed subsequence of a gridded permutation to be applied only to the underlying permutation. For example, given a gridded permutation $\pi = 1^{(0,0)}5^{(1,2)}2^{(2,0)}43^{(2,1)}$ and $S=\set{1,2,5}$ we have
\[
\st{\sseq{S}{\pi}} = \st{1^{(0,0)}5^{(1,2)}3^{(2,1)}} = 1^{(0,0)}3^{(1,2)}2^{(2,1)}.
\]
Using the extended definition of standardization we extend containment and avoidance to gridded permutations, for both individual and sets of gridded permutations. For example, the gridded permutation $1^{(0,0)}5^{(1,2)}2^{(2,0)}43^{(2,1)}$ contains $1^{(0,0)}2^{(2,0)}3^{(2,1)}$ but avoids $1^{(0,0)}23^{(2,1)}$.

Let $\mathcal{G}$ be the set of all gridded permutations and $\mathcal{G}_n$ its subset with only gridded permutations of length $n$. The set $\mathcal{G}$ is not a combinatorial class since $\mathcal{G}_n$ is infinite for all $n \in \Z^+$, having infinitely many cells to choose as positions. If we restrict the choice of cells to be finite, then so are the gridded permutations we can form. Let $\mathcal{G}^{(c,r)}$ be the set of gridded permutation with positions in 
\[
\{0,1,\dotsc,c-1\} \times \{0,1,\dotsc,r-1\}
\]
and
\[
\mathcal{G}^{(c,r)}_n = \cset{\pi \in \mathcal{G}^{(c,r)}}{|\pi| = n}.
\]
The set $\mathcal{G}^{(c,r)}$ is a combinatorial class. Define
\[
    \textsf{Av}^{(c,r)}\left(\Pi\right) = \cset{\pi \in \mathcal{G}^{(c,r)}}{\pi \text{ avoids } \Pi}
\]
and
\[
    \textsf{Av}_n^{(c,r)}\left(\Pi\right) = \cset{\pi \in \mathcal{G}_n^{(c,r)}}{\pi \text{ avoids } \Pi}.
\]

\section{Tilings\label{sec:tilings}}
A \emph{tiling} is a triple
\[
\mathcal{T} = ((c,r), \mathcal{O}, \set{\mathcal{R}_1,\mathcal{R}_2,\dotsc,\mathcal{R}_k})
\]
where
\[
    (c,r) \in \Z^+ \times \Z^+, \ \mathcal{O} \subseteq \mathcal{G}^{(c,r)} \text{ and } \mathcal{R}=\set{\mathcal{R}_1,\mathcal{R}_2,\dotsc,\mathcal{R}_k} \subseteq \left(\mathcal{G}^{(c,r)}\right)^k
\]
are called \emph{dimension}, \emph{obstructions} and \emph{requirements} respectively. The gridded permutations in $\textsf{Av}^{(c,r)}\left(\mathcal{O}\right)$ that contain $\mathcal{R}_1,\dotsc,\mathcal{R}_k$ make up the combinatorial class $\textsf{Grid}(\mathcal{T})$. A more detailed definition is given by Bean \cite{BeanPhd:phd}. An example of a tiling can be seen in \FigureRef{fig:tiling_example} where obstructions are red and requirements are blue. Cells with $12$ and $21$ obstruction and a $1$ requirement are represented with a larger black point.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{graphics/tiling}
    \caption{A $3 \times 2$ tiling with $\mathcal{O} = \set{1^{(0,0)},12^{(1,1)},21^{(1,1)},3^{(0,1)}1^{(1,0)}2^{(2,1)}}$ and $\mathcal{R} = \set{\set{1^{(1,1)}},\set{2^{(1,1)}1^{(2,0)}}}$.}
    \label{fig:tiling_example}
\end{figure}

Typically, when we want to enumerate $\Av{132}$ we start with a disjoint union constructor since a permutation in $\Av{132}$ is either empty or contains a largest point. If it contains a largest point, it must still avoid 132 on either side. Furthermore, the elements to the left of the largest point must be greater than those to its right or you have an occurrence of $132$ with the largest point. This is important since it allows us to uniquely map the elements to the right of the largest point from the rule. Now we have a specification
\begin{align*}
\Av{132} &\cong \set{\varepsilon} \sqcup \textsf{Av}_{\geq1}(132)\\
\textsf{Av}_{\geq1}(132) &\cong \Av{132} \times \set{\point{0.1}} \times \Av{132}
\end{align*}
and a generating function, obtained by solving the system of equations derived from the specification,
\[
\frac{1-\sqrt{1-4z}}{2z}.
\]
This is a simple example but given different classes and constructors, we can end up with classes that are difficult to describe accurately. The purpose of tilings is to provide a sort of language to describe classes with more complicated permutation constraints or limited parts of permutations, e.g., we can describe $\textsf{Av}_{\geq1}(132)$ with the tiling seen in \FigureRef{fig:tiling132}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{graphics/tiling_132_notempty}
    \caption{A tiling $\mathcal{T}$ with $\textsf{Grid}(\mathcal{T})$ isomorphic to $\textsf{Av}_{\geq1}(132)$.}
    \label{fig:tiling132}
\end{figure}

\section{Combinatorial Exploration}
Combinatorial Exploration \cite{css} is a domain agnostic specification searcher. It uses strategies to generate rules for classes. Strategies are independent of classes and describe an action that may result in rules given an applicable class. The search method is done in a breadth-first manner from the root class. When run, it uses a predefined set of strategies and expands a universe in hope of finding a specification within it.

To avoid tautologies, the searcher gives classes equivalence labels and tracks rules in terms of parent and children pairs as equivalence labels. The rules within a single equivalence label may or may not be equivalence rules. Any single child rule that could result in a tautology could be contained in an equivalence label with nonequivalent classes. When a specification is found and extracted from the universe, any sequence of equivalence rules is merged into a single rule.

\section{TileScope}
TileScope \cite{tiling} is an implementation of Combinatorial Exploration for tilings. The root class usually has a single cell and no requirements and therefore a direct correspondence to a permutation class. The library also utilizes Permuta \cite{permuta}, a general permutation library. Most of the strategies TileScope uses can be found in \authcite{BeanPhd:phd}. We will explain those that are not.
