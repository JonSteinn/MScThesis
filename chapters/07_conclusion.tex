\begin{itemize}
    \item Some reflection on what was built
    \item Something on fusion if we don't manage it
    \item Something on... that instead of searching for specs and then search "from those ashes", it would be much better to search for bijections directly, as in rewrite the search method. This could include as a heuristic, the number of matching children by constr+\#children. Maybe even some ML heuristic.
    \item Maybe something about discovering potential bijections of RHS classes, say if 3/4 children match but the 4th doesnt and they have the same enum up to x. Return conjectures. 
    \item If any conjectures, list here (doubt it)
\end{itemize}
