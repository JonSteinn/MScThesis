\begin{frame}{Conclusion and future work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First fully automatic bijections (that we know of).
        \item Offers structural insight.
        \item Discover equivalence rules.
        \item Use a search specifically for bijections.
        \item Continue classifying $n \times 4$ for $n < 9$.
    \end{itemize}
