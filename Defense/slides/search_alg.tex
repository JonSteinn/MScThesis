    \begin{itemize}
        \item Expands both universes until both contain specifications
        \item Gathers all the matched pairs
        \item Uses dynamic programming and backtracking
        \item A second tree search attempts to construct parallel specifications from matched pairs
        \item Detects false positives from recursion
    \end{itemize}
