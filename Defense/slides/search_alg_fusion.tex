\begin{frame}{Modifications for fusion and catalytic variables}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Catalytic variables in both cells require BFS to decide on reversing
        \item Equivalence labels can contain nonequivalent classes and required partial specification extraction during the search
        \item Catalytic variables were labelled when added to know which reached higher up the tree.
    \end{itemize}
